- ✅ **Error Handling**: PASS (invalid formats, empty content)
- ✅ **Performance Monitoring**: PASS (/metrics, /performance)

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### STT Engine Features:
```python
class SpeechEngine:
    - Optimized Whisper model loading with fallbacks
    - Audio validation and preprocessing
    - Enhanced error recovery (GPU memory issues)
    - Support for 22 Indian languages + English
    - Real-time processing capabilities
```

### Key Optimizations:
1. **Model Selection Strategy**: large-v3 → medium → small → base (automatic fallback)
2. **Audio Processing**: LibROSA preprocessing, silence trimming, format optimization
